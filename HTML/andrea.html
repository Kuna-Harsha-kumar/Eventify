    </div>

    <section>
        <h3>ONCE UPON A TIME</h3>
        <p>"Casablanca" is a classic romantic drama film that was released in 1942, set during World War II. 
            The film is known for its iconic characters, memorable dialogue, and timeless themes of love, 
            sacrifice, and redemption. It has been hailed as one of the greatest films of all time, and its 
            classic scenes and lines, such as "Here's looking at you, kid," have become embedded in popular 
            culture. "Casablanca" is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences nearly 
            80 years after its release.</p>

        <h3>WHAT'S THE STORY?</h3>
        <p>The film tells the story of Rick Blaine (played by Humphrey Bogart), a cynical American 
            expatriate who runs a popular nightclub in the Moroccan city of Casablanca. As the war rages 
            on in Europe, refugees flock to Casablanca in the hopes of obtaining exit visas that will 
            allow them to escape to America. Among them is Rick's former lover, Ilsa Lund (played by 
            Ingrid Bergman), who had abandoned him years earlier without explanation. When Ilsa unexpectedly 
            shows up in Casablanca with her husband, a renowned resistance fighter named Victor Laszlo, 
            Rick finds himself caught up in a dangerous web of political intrigue and personal loyalties. 
            Despite his bitterness towards Ilsa, Rick begins to realize that he still has feelings for her, 
            and he must decide whether to help her and her husband escape the city, or to save himself and 
            his own interests.</p>
