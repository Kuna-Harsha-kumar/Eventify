    <h2>THE MOVIE COLLECTION</h2>
    <p>
      This movie collection website is designed as a comprehensive digital
      library for organizing, browsing, and managing a wide range of films.
      Users can explore movies by genre, release year, language, or rating, and
      view detailed information including cast, synopsis, trailers, and reviews.
      The site aims to create an intuitive and visually appealing experience,
      allowing film enthusiasts to easily build and maintain their personal
      collection while discovering new titles to enjoy. A search feature and
      sorting filters ensure quick access to any movie in the database.

    <p>
      Developed as part of a database management course project, this website
      focuses on the practical application of relational database concepts such
      as normalization, relationships, indexing, and query optimization. The
      backend efficiently handles movie data storage, user inputs, and real-time
      updates, while the frontend presents the information in a user-friendly
      layout. This project not only demonstrates technical skills in web
      development and SQL but also showcases a real-world use case for organized
      data handling in a media-rich domain.
