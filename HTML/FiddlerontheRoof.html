      <h3>Why Fiddler on the Roof?</h3>
      <p>
        Fiddler on the Roof is a musical with music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by
        Sheldon Harnick, and book by Joseph Stein, set in the Pale of Settlement
        of Imperial Russia in or around 1905. It is based on Tevye and his
        Daughters (or Tevye the Dairyman) and other tales by Sholem Aleichem.
        The story centers on Tevye, a milkman in the village of Anatevka, who
        attempts to maintain his Jewish religious and cultural traditions as
        outside influences encroach upon his family's lives. He must cope with
        the strong-willed actions of his three older daughters who wish to marry
        for love; their choices of husbands are successively less palatable for
        Tevye. An edict of the tsar eventually evicts the Jews from their
        village.

      <p>
        The original Broadway production of the show, which opened in 1964, had
        the first musical theatre run in history to surpass 3,000 performances.
        Fiddler held the record for the longest-running Broadway musical for
        almost 10 years until Grease surpassed its run. The production was
        extraordinarily profitable and highly acclaimed. It won nine Tony
        Awards, including best musical, score, book, direction, and
        choreography. It spawned five Broadway revivals and a highly successful
        1971 film adaptation and has enjoyed enduring international popularity.
        It has also been a popular choice for school and community productions.
