                    <h3>THE LONELY FEW</h3>
                    <p>Lila (Lauren Patten, Tony Award winner for Jagged Little Pill) is getting by in her Kentucky 
                        hometown—scanning groceries at the Save-A-Lot, caring for her erratic brother, and living 
                        for Friday nights, when she plays a gig with her band The Lonely Few. And that's enough. Or 
                        she thought it was, until Amy (Ciara Renée, Frozen, Waitress), an established musician ragged 
                        from the road, passes through and offers her a shot at something much, much bigger. But is Lila 
                        ready for the life she never dared to imagine? A world premiere musical by Zoe Sarnak and Rachel 
                        Bonds, The Lonely Few is a love story between two women searching for a sense of home. This play 
                        was commissioned as part of the Geffen Playhouse's New Play Development Program thanks to the 
                        generosity of Sandra Krause and William Fitzgerald.</p>

                        several couples during a weekend in the country. The plot centers around a renowned actress named

                        to a much younger woman named Anne. The other characters in the story include the jealous Count 
                        Carl-Magnus, his long-suffering wife Charlotte, and their servant Petra. The musical is known for 
                        its intricate score by Stephen Sondheim, including the popular songs "Send in the Clowns" and "A 
                        Weekend in the Country," as well as its clever lyrics and witty dialogue. Overall, "A Little Night 
                        Music" is a sophisticated and charming musical that explores the complexities of love and desire 
                        with humor and insight.</p>
