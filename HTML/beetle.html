  <h3>Why Watch Beetlejuice?</h3>
  <h3>Once Upon a Time</h3>
  <p>
    "Beetlejuice" is a dark comedy film released in 1988, directed by Tim Burton and starring Michael Keaton in the titular role. 
    The film is known for its quirky and offbeat humor, as well as its innovative special effects and gothic visual style. 
    It also features a memorable musical score by composer Danny Elfman, which has become a cult classic in its own right. 
    "Beetlejuice" was a commercial and critical success upon its release, and has since become a beloved classic in the horror-comedy genre. 
    It has also inspired various spin-offs, including a Broadway musical adaptation that premiered in 2019.
  </p>

  <h3>What's the Story?</h3>
  <p>
    The film follows a recently deceased couple, Barbara and Adam Maitland, who become ghosts and are trapped in their home in Connecticut.
    Desperate to escape, they seek the help of a "bio-exorcist" named Beetlejuice, who claims he can help them scare away the living family 
    who has moved into their home. However, the Maitlands soon discover that Beetlejuice is far from trustworthy, and chaos ensues as he 
    wreaks havoc on both the living and the dead.
