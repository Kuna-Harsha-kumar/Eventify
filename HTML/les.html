                <h3>WHAT'S THE STORY?</h3>
                <p>The story takes place in 19th-century France and follows the life of Jean Valjean, a French 
                    peasant who is imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's starving child. 
                    After serving 19 years in prison, Valjean is released on parole but is constantly pursued by 
                    the ruthless police inspector Javert. Valjean breaks his parole and begins a new life under a 
                    false identity, becoming a successful businessman and mayor of a small town. However, Javert 
                    continues to track him down, leading to a series of events that test Valjean's moral character 
                    and force him to confront his past. The story also includes several other characters, such as 
                    Fantine, a single mother who is forced into prostitution to provide for her daughter Cosette; 
                    Marius Pontmercy, a young revolutionary who falls in love with Cosette; and Eponine, a streetwise 
                    girl who has unrequited feelings for Marius.</p>
