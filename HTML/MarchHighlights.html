                <h3>FIDDLER ON THE ROOF</h3>
                <p>Fiddler on the Roof is a musical with music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, 
                    and book by Joseph Stein, set in the Pale of Settlement of Imperial Russia in or around 1905. 
                    It is based on Tevye and his Daughters (or Tevye the Dairyman) and other tales by Sholem Aleichem. 
                    The story centers on Tevye, a milkman in the village of Anatevka, who attempts to maintain his 
                    Jewish religious and cultural traditions as outside influences encroach upon his family's lives.
                    He must cope with the strong-willed actions of his three older daughters who wish to marry for love; 
                    their choices of husbands are successively less palatable for Tevye. An edict of the tsar eventually 
                    evicts the Jews from their village.
