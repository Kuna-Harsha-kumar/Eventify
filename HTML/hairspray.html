        <h3>WHY WATCH HAIRSPRAY?</h3>
        <p>"Hairspray" is a musical comedy based on the 2002 Broadway musical of the same name, 
           which was in turn based on the 1988 film by John Waters. Set in Baltimore in the 1960s, the 
           film is filled with catchy musical numbers and lively dance sequences, as well as humor and 
           heart. Ultimately, "Hairspray" is a story about the power of inclusivity, acceptance, and 
           standing up for what is right. It offers a fun and inspiring message that is sure to 
           resonate with audiences of all ages.</p>

        <h3>WHAT'S THE STORY?</h3>
        <p>The movie "Hairspray" tells the story of Tracy Turnblad, a teenage girl who dreams of dancing on 
           "The Corny Collins Show," a popular local TV dance program. Despite facing discrimination and 
           ridicule for her size and unconventional appearance, Tracy is determined to achieve her dream. 
           She begins attending auditions for the show and makes new friends, including a group of African American 
           students fighting for integration and equal rights. As Tracy's star rises on the show, she becomes increasingly 
           involved in the civil rights movement and uses her newfound platform to advocate for change. However, 
           she faces opposition from the show's producer, Velma Von Tussle, and her scheming daughter Amber, 
           who are determined to maintain the status quo and keep the show segregated.</p>
